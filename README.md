# NLP Internship at IIT-G

This repository contains the code files and resources related to my one-month internship at the Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati (IIT-G). I worked under the supervision of Dr. Ranbir Sanasam Singh, where I received training on the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and gained knowledge about various concepts and models in the field.

## Project Overview

During the internship, I focused on building a strong foundation in NLP. Here are the key areas I worked on:

1. **NLP Basics**: I received comprehensive training on the fundamentals of NLP, including understanding text data, tokenization, and feature extraction.

2. **Mathematical Foundations**: I learned about activation functions, loss functions, and optimization functions, which form the backbone of deep learning models in NLP.

3. **Models**: I gained hands-on experience with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for NLP tasks. These models are widely used in the field for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation.

4. **Data Preprocessing**: I extensively worked on data preprocessing techniques, which are crucial for cleaning and preparing text data for modeling. This involved tasks such as handling missing data, removing noise, and performing text normalization.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `models/`: This directory contains the implementation of the RNN and CNN models I learned during the internship.

- `data_preprocessing/`: Here, you can find the code and scripts related to the data preprocessing tasks I worked on.

- `resources/`: This directory includes additional resources, such as datasets, research papers, and tutorials, that I found useful during the internship.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nlp-internship-iitg.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```shell
   cd nlp-internship-iitg
   ```

3. Explore the different directories to find the code files related to specific tasks, such as models or data preprocessing.

## Resources

In addition to the code files, I have included a list of resources that I found helpful during my internship. You can find them in the `resources/` directory. Feel free to explore these materials to deepen your understanding of NLP and related topics.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Ranbir Sanasam Singh for providing me with this opportunity to work on NLP during my internship at IIT-G. Their guidance and support were invaluable in my learning journey.
Also, I would like thank Dr. R. Manimegalai, Head of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, for providing me with this opportunity.
